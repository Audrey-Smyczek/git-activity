I like to blame my lack of romantic love on my parents.
After having multiple failed relationships, caused by my onset issues of trust and the fact my name is Gerald, I fear I had no luck.
The amount of times I have longed for a pair of womanly hooves to pat my antlers, I lack touch so much sometimes I scratch myself alongside oak trees.
