Gerald had been going through a lot lately.
There is just so much going on, his dog left him, his favorite pair of pants split, and his job is sad.
He doesn't know what to do anymore.
Everything is just so dang stressful.
But then...
One Day...
Gerald has an idea.
He is going to wander.
He is going to wander until he finds what his is looking for.
Dare I say... he can go the distance.
Gerald packed up his apartment and took his second pair of pants and his 2 plants and got on the road.
He packed everything up into his scooter and drove away.
